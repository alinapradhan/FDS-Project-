problem statment :
"Analyze the nuclear explosions dataset by performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, detect anomalies, and visualize key attributes. Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and identify the most significant features influencing nuclear detonations. Finally, develop a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict the purpose of nuclear explosions based on their characteristics, ensuring effective handling of imbalanced data and optimizing model performance."
